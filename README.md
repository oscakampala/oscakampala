# OSCA KAMPALA CHAPTER
Hello everyone, and I'd Like to welcome you to the official OSCA KAMPALA CHAPTER.
This is the Ugandan branch of an African wide community called Open Source Community Africa,
OSCA in short, and that's where we derive our name.
The Purpose for such a community is to bring together African, and for this case, Ugandan Developers
in order to solve some of the problems affecting the African community.
One of the problems that this community wishes to solve is the problem of being more of "tech users"
than "tech developers". We are therefore here to encourage the African Developer community to start
building real world production level tools to tackle read world problems.

### OUR ROADMAP
A Roadmap is a way of organising our development journey so that the community can have an orderly
development procedure.
You can read through our roadmap [here](/roadmap.md)

### MADE IN UGANDA
We are making a curated list of developers in Uganda and the projects they are working on.
The curated list is going to be a central repository for the Ugandan made software. This will
act as a catalogue to showcase the various projects that the community is working on.
This list shall be contained in the made-in-uganda repository which you can find [here](https://github.com/oscakampala/made-in-uganda)

##### Adding to the central repository
Here are the instructions for you to make an orderly edit to the made-in-uganda repository
1. First,the made-in-uganda repository will contain the list in form of md files. Write a proper presentation 
and description of your project in an md file and save it.
2. Secondly, fork the made-in-uganda repository and add the md file into that repository on your account
3. create a pull request to the central made-in-uganda repository.
4. after evaluation, your pull request shall be merged into the main branch

### PROJECT REQUEST
If you have a project idea and you would really like to put out out there so that you can get a group of members to help you out with it,
you can create a **PROJECT REQUEST**
For now, The procedure for making a project request is not yet defined. However, discussion on how to go about it shall be 
carried out for our social media platforms. you can find our link tree [here](https://bit.ly/2TJkBy8) which contain all links to
our social media platforms.

professional fields while others are still students in colleges and highschool, trying to get involved in the open source industry.
